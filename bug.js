This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common issue in React Native, often stemming from asynchronous operations where data hasn't yet loaded when the component tries to render.  For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect - potential error
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUserData().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> {/* Potential error here */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

The `user` object might be null when the component first renders because the `fetchUserData` function is asynchronous. Trying to access `user.name` before the data has been fetched will cause a TypeError.
